This is a widget which is part of the splace.at magazine.

A demo of this widget to be viewed on a mobile device can be found here:

In portrait mode you can tilt your device and switch between a 360° view and the map view.

In the 360° view turn around to view a panoramic view (currently of the area around Rechberg in Upper-Austria).
